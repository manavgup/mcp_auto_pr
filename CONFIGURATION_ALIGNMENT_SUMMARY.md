# Configuration Alignment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to align the pre-commit hooks configuration with CI/CD workflows, ensuring consistency across all development environments.

## Issues Identified
1. **Line Length Inconsistency**: Pre-commit used 100, pyproject.toml used 88, CI workflows used defaults
2. **Tool Version Mismatches**: Pre-commit config had different versions than pyproject.toml
3. **CI Workflow Issues**: Missing pre-commit hook installation step
4. **Inconsistent Arguments**: Different line length arguments across Makefile, CI workflows, and configs

## Changes Made

### 1. Line Length Standardization
- **Updated to**: 120 characters (increased from 88/100)
- **Files updated**:
  - `pyproject.toml` - Ruff configuration (replaced Black and isort)
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Consolidated to Ruff hooks only
  - `Makefile` - All formatting and linting commands updated to use Ruff
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI workflow tool arguments updated to use Ruff

### 2. Tool Consolidation and Version Alignment
- **Consolidated to Ruff**: Replaced Black and isort with Ruff for both formatting and import sorting
- **Ruff**: Updated from `v0.1.13` to `v0.1.11` (matches pyproject.toml)
- **Eliminated conflicts**: Single tool now handles all formatting and import sorting

### 3. CI Workflow Fixes
- **Added missing step**: `pre-commit install` before running hooks
- **Updated tool arguments**: Added `--line-length=120` to all CI tool commands
- **Files updated**:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added hook installation
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Added line length arguments

### 4. Makefile Updates
- **All formatting commands**: Added `--line-length 120`
- **All linting commands**: Added `--line-length 120`
- **Consistent arguments**: Black, Ruff, and isort now use same line length

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Consolidated to Ruff hooks only, removed Black and isort
- `pyproject.toml` - Ruff configuration only, removed Black and isort configs
- `mypy.ini` - No changes needed (already aligned)

### CI/CD Workflows
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added pre-commit hook installation
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Added line length arguments

### Build System
- `Makefile` - Updated all tool commands with consistent line length

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Eliminates "Works on My Machine" Issues**: All environments now use identical configurations
2. **Consistent Code Formatting**: Same line length across all tools and environments
3. **Reliable CI/CD**: Pre-commit hooks are properly installed before running
4. **Maintainable Configuration**: Single source of truth for line length (120 characters)
5. **Developer Experience**: Local pre-commit runs match CI expectations exactly

## Verification

To verify the alignment is working:

```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks locally
make pre-commit-run

# Check that CI workflow would use same configuration
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Verify line length is consistent
grep -r "line-length" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.toml" --include="Makefile" .
```

## Future Maintenance

- **Line Length Changes**: Update all files simultaneously when changing line length
- **Tool Version Updates**: Ensure pyproject.toml and pre-commit config versions match
- **New Tools**: Follow the same pattern of consistent line length arguments
- **CI Updates**: Always test pre-commit hooks in CI workflows

## Notes

- Line length increased to 120 to provide more space for descriptive variable names and complex expressions
- **Tool consolidation**: Replaced Black and isort with Ruff to eliminate formatting conflicts
- Ruff now handles both code formatting and import sorting with consistent line length
- CI workflows now properly install pre-commit hooks before running them
- Makefile commands updated to use Ruff consistently across all targets
