# Epic 3: Development Workflow

## üìã Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: E3
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Sprint**: 1
**Dependencies**: None (can run parallel with other epics)

## üéØ Epic Goal
Establish a clean, consistent development workflow across all repositories with standardized tooling and no uncommitted changes blocking development.

## üö´ Current Problems

- Inconsistent pre-commit configurations (4 different files)
- Different linting rules and formatting standards
- Missing or outdated development setup documentation
- No clear contribution guidelines

## üéØ Epic Outcome
A streamlined development workflow where:
- All repositories have clean git status
- Consistent code quality standards enforced
- Pre-commit hooks work reliably
- New developers can get started quickly
- Clear guidelines for code contributions
