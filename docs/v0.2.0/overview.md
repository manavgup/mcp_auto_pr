# MCP Auto PR v0.2.0 Release Plan

## 🎯 Release Objective
Stabilize and improve the existing multi-repository architecture with focus on reliability, test coverage, and developer experience.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working
- PyPI packages published successfully (v0.1.0)
- Core MCP functionality operational
- Docker deployment functional
- Basic CI/CD infrastructure exists

### 🔴 Critical Issues
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failures** - GitHub Actions failing consistently
- **Low Test Coverage** - 15% analyzer, 0% recommender, 13% shared lib
- **Uncommitted Changes** - Development workflow disrupted across repos
- **Configuration Drift** - Inconsistent pre-commit and linting setup

### 🟡 Improvement Opportunities
- Shared library structure could be cleaner
- Documentation needs updates
- Security scanning not configured
- Docker setup could be enhanced

## 🚀 Release Strategy: Pragmatic Incremental Improvement

**Philosophy**: Fix critical issues first, then enhance. Avoid big-bang changes.
