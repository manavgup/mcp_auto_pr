# Epic 1: CI/CD Stability

## 📋 Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: E1
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Estimated Effort**: 3 days
**Sprint**: 1
**Dependencies**: None

## 🎯 Epic Goal
Establish a stable, reliable CI/CD pipeline that consistently runs tests, performs quality checks, and provides clear feedback to developers.

## 🚫 Current Problems
- GitHub Actions workflows failing with exit code 127
- Inconsistent test execution across repositories
- Missing dependencies causing build failures
- Security scan permission errors
- No standardized quality gates

## 🎯 Epic Outcome
A robust CI/CD pipeline that:
- Runs all tests consistently across Python versions
- Performs code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Provides test coverage reporting
- Includes basic security scanning
- Fails fast with clear error messages

## 📋 User Stories

### Story 1.1: Fix GitHub Actions Workflow Failures
**As a** developer
**I want** the CI pipeline to run successfully
**So that** I can trust automated testing and merge with confidence

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows pass without exit code 127 errors
- [ ] Workflows run successfully on push to main/master branches
- [ ] Workflows run successfully on pull request creation/updates
- [ ] Clear error messages when workflows fail

#### Tasks
- [ ] Investigate current workflow failures
- [ ] Fix missing dependency issues (shellcheck, yamllint)
- [ ] Update workflow permissions for security scanning
- [ ] Test workflows with different trigger events
- [ ] Document workflow requirements

### Story 1.2: Standardized Test Execution
**As a** developer
**I want** tests to run consistently across all repositories
**So that** I can rely on test results and catch regressions early

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests run successfully on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- [ ] Same test commands work locally and in CI
- [ ] Test failures provide clear debugging information
- [ ] Test execution time is reasonable (<10 minutes total)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Standardize Poetry configuration across repos
- [ ] Ensure consistent test dependencies
- [ ] Set up matrix testing for Python versions
- [ ] Configure test output formatting
- [ ] Add test timing and performance monitoring

### Story 1.3: Code Quality Pipeline
**As a** developer
**I want** automated code quality checks
**So that** code standards are maintained and issues are caught early

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Linting runs with Ruff on all Python code
- [ ] Code formatting checked with Black
- [ ] Type checking runs with mypy
- [ ] Import sorting checked with isort (if used)
- [ ] Quality checks fail the build if standards not met

#### Tasks
- [ ] Configure Ruff linting rules
- [ ] Set up Black formatting checks
- [ ] Configure mypy type checking
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hook validation
- [ ] Document code quality standards

### Story 1.4: Test Coverage Reporting
**As a** developer
**I want** to see test coverage reports
**So that** I can identify untested code and improve test quality

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coverage reports generated for each repository
- [ ] Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov or similar
- [ ] Coverage badges displayed in README files
- [ ] Coverage trends tracked over time
- [ ] Minimum coverage thresholds enforced

#### Tasks
- [ ] Configure pytest-cov for coverage collection
- [ ] Set up Codecov integration
- [ ] Create coverage report artifacts
- [ ] Add coverage badges to README files
- [ ] Set initial coverage thresholds (50% minimum)

### Story 1.5: Basic Security Scanning
**As a** developer
**I want** basic security vulnerabilities detected
**So that** security issues are identified before deployment

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning runs successfully
- [ ] Secret scanning detects common secrets
- [ ] Security scan results reported clearly
- [ ] High/critical vulnerabilities fail the build
- [ ] Security scan permissions configured correctly

#### Tasks
- [ ] Fix GitHub token permissions for security scanning
- [ ] Configure Trivy for dependency scanning
- [ ] Set up secret scanning with appropriate rules
- [ ] Configure security scan result reporting
- [ ] Document security scan process

## ✅ Definition of Done

### Story-Level DoD
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed by at least one other person (if team)
- [ ] Tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs introduced

### Epic-Level DoD
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully for 48 hours
- [ ] All repositories have consistent workflow configuration
- [ ] Coverage reporting working for all packages
- [ ] Security scans passing or issues documented
- [ ] Team can confidently merge PRs based on CI results
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<10 minutes total build time)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test workflow configuration parsing
- [ ] Test individual CI steps in isolation
- [ ] Mock external dependencies for testing

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full workflow execution tests
- [ ] Cross-repository dependency testing
- [ ] Test coverage integration validation

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Complete PR workflow from creation to merge
- [ ] Release workflow testing
- [ ] Rollback scenario testing

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **CI Success Rate**: >95% over 1 week period
- **Build Time**: <10 minutes average
- **Test Reliability**: <2% flaky test rate
- **Coverage Accuracy**: Reports match local results

### Secondary Metrics
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on CI reliability
- **Issue Resolution Time**: <1 day for CI-related issues
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% for quality checks

## 🚧 Risks & Dependencies

### Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| GitHub Actions quota exceeded | Low | Medium | Monitor usage, optimize workflows |
| Test flakiness increases | Medium | Medium | Identify and fix flaky tests |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Monitor build times, optimize steps |
| Breaking changes in dependencies | Low | High | Pin dependency versions, test updates |

### Dependencies
- GitHub repository permissions
- Poetry and Python environments
- External services (Codecov, etc.)
- No blocking dependencies from other epics

## 📝 Notes
- Focus on quick wins first - fix obvious errors before complex improvements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Document all changes for future maintenance
- Consider workflow performance from the start
