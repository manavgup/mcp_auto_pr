## Alternative: GitHub Projects Only

If you prefer not to create an organization, you could use GitHub Projects to manage across your existing repositories:

### Pros:
- Simpler setup
- Keep existing repository ownership
- Cross-repository project management

### Cons:
- Less professional appearance
- Harder to manage permissions and teams
- Limited organization-level features
- Scattered documentation

## Recommendation

**Create a GitHub Organization** for the following reasons:
1. Your project has multiple interconnected repositories
2. You have comprehensive planning and documentation needs
3. The project scope suggests potential for growth
4. Professional presentation benefits
5. Better long-term maintainability

The organization structure provides the best foundation for your automated PR creation project while maintaining flexibility for future expansion.
