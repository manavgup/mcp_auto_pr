# Remove mcp-shared-lib from PyPI

The mcp-shared-lib package is no longer needed since it's now bundled directly into both MCP servers.

## To remove it from PyPI:

1. **Go to PyPI package page**: https://pypi.org/project/mcp-shared-lib/
2. **Click "Manage"** (you need to be logged in)
3. **Go to "Settings"** tab
4. **Scroll down to "Delete project"**
5. **Type the package name** to confirm deletion
6. **Click "Delete project"**

## Why remove it?

- ✅ **Clean PyPI presence** - Only show the two MCP servers users actually need
- ✅ **Prevent confusion** - Users won't accidentally install the shared lib directly
- ✅ **Cleaner architecture** - Shared lib is now truly internal implementation detail

## Current status:

**Published packages (v0.3.0):**
- ✅ `mcp-local-repo-analyzer` - Git change analysis (bundled, self-contained)
- ✅ `mcp-pr-recommender` - AI-powered PR recommendations (bundled, self-contained)

**To be removed:**
- ❌ `mcp-shared-lib` - No longer needed (code bundled into servers)

## User experience after removal:

```bash
# Clean, simple installation - only the MCP servers they need
pip install mcp-local-repo-analyzer
pip install mcp-pr-recommender
```

No dependency on external shared library - each package is completely self-contained!
